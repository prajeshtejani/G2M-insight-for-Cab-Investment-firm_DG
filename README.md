# Cab Company Analysis
This repository contains Python code for analyzing the performance and profitability of two cab companies: Yellow Cab and Pink Cab. The analysis is based on a dataset consisting of information about cab rides, customers, transactions, and cities.

# Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following files:
- Cab_Data.csv: Information about cab rides, including the date of travel, distance traveled, price charged, cost of the trip, etc.
- City.csv: Information about cities, including population and number of users.
- Customer_ID.csv: Information about customers, including age, gender, and income.
- Transaction_ID.csv: Information about transactions, including payment mode and company.

# Analysis Steps
  - Data Preprocessing:
  Checked for missing values and performed data type conversion.
  Merged different datasets based on common columns.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  Visualized distributions of key variables such as distance traveled, price charged, cost of the trip, age, income, population, and number of users for both companies.
  Detected and removed outliers using box plots and the interquartile range (IQR) method.
  - Profit Analysis:
  Calculated profit metrics per ride and per year for both Yellow Cab and Pink Cab.
  Analyzed profit trends over the years and compared profitability between the two companies.
  Explored profit distribution based on gender, age, and income groups.
  - Insights:
  Found that Yellow Cab had higher per ride and per year profits compared to Pink Cab.
  Discovered that profitability was not significantly influenced by gender.
  Identified age group and income level preferences of cab users.

# Conclusion
- Yellow Cab demonstrated higher profitability compared to Pink Cab.
- Profitability was not strongly correlated with gender but showed patterns based on age group and income level.
- Further analysis and business strategies could be developed based on these insights.
